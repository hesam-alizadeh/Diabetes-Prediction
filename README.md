# Diabetes-Prediction

The aim of this analysis is to investigate a range of health-related factors and their interconnections to classify diabetes accurately. These factors include aspects such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. This comprehensive examination will not only provide insights into the patterns and trends in diabetes risk but will also create a solid base for further research. Specifically, research can be built on how these variables interact and influence diabetes occurrence and progression, crucial knowledge for improving patient care and outcomes in this increasingly critical area of healthcare.
